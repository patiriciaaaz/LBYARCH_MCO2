# LBYARCH Machine Project 2

By Ruth Yee and Patricia Zamora (S14)

# Overview
This project implements a kernel that calculates the Euclidean distances between coordinate points across two vectors. The kernel is implemented in two versions: a C version and an x86-64 assembly language version using SIMD floating-point instructions. The goal is to compare the performance and correctness of both implementations across different input sizes and evaluate the execution time for various vector lengths.
